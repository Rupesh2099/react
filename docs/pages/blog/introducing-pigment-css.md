Introduction - start by stating the problem as clearly as possible: last gen’s CSS-in-JS solutions are incompatible with the new paradigm of React Server Components and the Next.js App Router. That’s why we created Pigment CSS.

## What are React Server Components?

Briefly explain what RSCs are and why old CSS-in-JS solutions don’t work with them.

## Why Pigment CSS?

Explain the shortcomings of Emotion/styled-components

## How Pigment CSS works

Show how Pigment CSS solves the problem outlined above. Explain how it works in 2-3 paragraphs with a few code snippets. Can derive this text from the doc on this topic.

## Benefits of using Pigment CSS

### Better performance

Benchmarks - compare Pigment to Emotion and others

### Familiar developer experience

Use code snippets to show how similar it is to Emotion in terms of DX

### Future-proof solution

Elaborate on the idea that Material UI is keeping up with the latest and greatest React features, AND that Pigment is not exclusively for use with Material UI.

## Get started with Pigment CSS

Conclude by telling users where to go and what to do to get started. Link to Next.js and Vite starters. Invite users to star the repo and open issues.
