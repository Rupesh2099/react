# React Engineer â€” Docs Infra

<p class="description">You will drive the development of the documentation platform that powers all MUI products, enabling it to grow and establish itself as a mature product.</p>

## Details of the role

- **Location**: Remote (preference for UTC-5 to UTC+2).
- **Type of work**: Full-time (contractor or employee [depending on circumstances](https://mui-org.notion.site/Hiring-FAQ-64763b756ae44c37b47b081f98915501#494af1f358794028beb4b7697b5d3102)).
- **Level**: [IC3 or above](https://mui-org.notion.site/Leveling-at-MUI-5c30f9bfe65149d697f346447cef9db1).
- We're a **remote** company, we prefer asynchronous communication over meetings.

## The company

MUI's story began in 2014 with MaterialÂ UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
Today, MaterialÂ UI stands as one of the most popular open-source libraries on GitHub and has paved the way for the fully-fledged startup known as MUI (founded in 2019), which now boasts an ever-expanding ecosystem of React UI products.
We're a company of 31+ people as of late 2023, and we're growing.

## The products

MUI is best known for our flagship product, MaterialÂ UIâ€”but this is just one of three core component libraries we maintain.
BaseÂ UI is our headless component library, and JoyÂ UI is a sister library to MaterialÂ UI that implements our own in-house Joy Design system.
We also host Design Kits and pre-built Templates.

Beyond the core libraries, MUIÂ X offers advanced components like the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, and Charts, for more complex user interactions and data visualization needs.

We're also making ambitious moves to incorporate our full suite of components into Toolpad, a low-code admin builder tool for assembling full-stack apps faster than ever.

## The culture

MUI is a fully remote company with a team that spans the globe.
The majority of our work is asynchronous, and we rely on written communication to collaborate.
We're radically transparent: nearly all of our work happens in public.
Each contributor has the freedom to decide how and when they work, and that work is primarily self-directed: it's your responsibility to define and complete your own tasks in a timely manner.

## Why we're hiring

Documentation is arguably one the most essential pieces of any of our products.
It's how developers learn about each corner of a given library, becoming empowered to bend them to the needs of their projects.
It also plays as an illustration of the principles we hold true to the product. It needs to be performative, fast, beautiful, and clear.

Over the last two years, we have established an internal docs-infra team responsible for pushing the documentation platform forward, developing features such as automatically-generated OG images, multi-tab component demos, speed performance improvements, and many others.

With that in mind, we're looking for someone to own the documentation as a product and become the first full-time dedicated person to it.
We want to make it significantly more mature so that many other features (including those with revenue generation capacity) can come to life.

## The role

The Docs Infra team currently doesn't have anyone dedicated to it full-time.
So, as the first React engineer to be primarily focused on it, you will work on developing new features and infrastructure-related tasks that will, ultimately, make documentation generation and consumption smoother, better, and faster.

This role involves touching on a piece of MUI's infrastructure that all of our products depend on, so you will have frequent opportunities to interact with the whole company.
On a day-to-day basis, it will be a very dynamic role, as you'll have tasks that range from being more operational to user-facing.
You will also play a fundamental role in defining the Docs Infra roadmap and priorities.

### Key responsibilities

- Ensure the documentation feels fast and snappy for readers.
  You'll be closely keeping tabs on Lighthouse scores and bundle size
- Develop new features that will enhance the way the libraries are showcased
- Improve content findability by refining the documentation search quality
- Ensure SEO and accessibility are strong and stable
- Improve the documentation authoring experience for both the maintainers and the community
- Own any infrastructure-related tasks, like managing dependencies, analytics, TypeScript modules, and hosting allowing each product team to never worry about the documentation platform and be 100% focused on their product

### Tasks and initiatives you might take on

- Migrate the docs platform to Next.js App Router
- Allow users to search the docs within a specific product scope
- Enable to store different parts of our documentation in different repositories
- Improve the blog experience by introducing new elements like a CMS
- Standardize the documentation design and layout across all of MUI's products
- Enhance our code blocks with ref
- Introduce a more scalable solution for hosting videos
- Introduce a CDN for managing images

## Who we're looking for

### Required

- You're comfortable with the modern JavaScript ecosystem, which, aside from React, includes tools like TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, Webpack, and Babel
- You get energized to dive into complex problems
- You're excited about helping engineers and designers build amazing UIs
- You're highly empathetic
- Great written and spoken English skills
- Basic design skills

### Nice to have (but not required)

- Good design skills
- Experience in open-source
- Experience with design systems
- Experience with MUI products

## Benefits and compensation

Competitive compensation depending on the profile and location.
We are ready to pay top market rates for a person that can clearly exceed the role's expectations.
